# clj-foundation

Describes and specifies best practices at Brad's Deals for working in Clojure.

Libraries making additional simple things easy and hard things possible in Clojure.

For example:

* Variable and data structure declaration; common design pattern implementations
* Error processing and timeouts
* Easier serialization / deserialization / EDN resource reading
* Math extensions supporting mixed numbers and converting various units of time

This is where ShopSmart/Brad's Deals places Clojure language-level utilities that are
useful across all Clojure projects.
